**TL;DR**: In this study, we developed agent-based models of tumour growth and clonal evolution to study the features of clonal diversification in space and time. Previously, a non-monotic diversity-size relation in clear cell Renal Cell Carcinomas (ccRCCs), where clonal diversity doesn't always increase with tumour sizes, was uncovered through multi-region sequencing in the Tracking Renal Cell Cancer Evolution through therapy (TRACERx Renal) study ([EGA archive: EGAD00001004067](https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001002793 "Data on EGA")). Through computational modelling, we showed that distinct growth patterns, specifically Surface Growth and Volume Growth
