**Summary of the study**: In this study, we developed an agent-based model of tumour growth and clonal evolution to study the features of clonal diversification in space and time. We linked our modelling analysis to the multi-region sequencing data in the Tracking Renal Cell Cancer Evolution through therapy (TRACERx Renal) study ([EGA archive: EGAD00001004067](https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001002793 "Data on EGA")). Through computational modelling, we found that distinct growth patterns, specifically, Surface Growth and Volume Growth, give rise to different extents and spatio-temporal features of clonal diversification. In corraboration with data, "power law" patterns characterising the spatial features of clonal diveristy in the model are also observed in the ccRCC tumours and, interestingly, show an association with the rate of progression according to published clinical annotation. Overall, Surface Growth models reflect more branched tumours with attenuated progression, while Volume Growth models show dichotomous patterns of evolution and can reflect either indolent tumours with lack of evolution or aggressive tumours with rapid progression. *In-silico* time-course studies reveal divergent temporal trajectories of evolution in Surface and Volume Growth models, which plausibly explain the apparent non-monotic relationship between clonal diversity and primary tumour sizes in ccRCCs. A subset of early-stage tumours with radiological evidence of budding structures, consistent with appearances of simulated tumours at the early stage of subclonal advantageous outgrowth in Surface Growth models, are predicted to undergo more extensive clonal diversification.
